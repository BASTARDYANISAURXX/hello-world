# hello-world
this is a mastery check for my grade 12 computer science class
I am a grade 12 high school student
I plan on studying computer science and computer engineering at the University of Toronto
I like to spend my free time reading and working on my main hobby
My current main hobby is gundam figure building
Gundam building is similar to building with legos but the final product is significantly better looking
Gundam building is basically just model building
My favorite sport is basketball and I try to play ut whenever I get the chance to do so
I have recently gotten into European football
My favorite team is Liverpool of the Premier League
